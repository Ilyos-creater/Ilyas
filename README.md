# Ilyas El-Hallaoui
DevOps Learner, Cloud Learner, Kubernetes Learner. Hello, I am Ilyas I am currently 19 years old and next to my internship I self study DevOps and Cloud. I mostly work/learn Kubernetes, AWS, Linux and Python. At least these are my main Focus Points, when it comes to self Studying. 

## I run my own DevOps Community:

## Things I have built


### Cloud Resume Challenge



## AWS
I am actively learning AWS since the beginning of my Journey and I decided to focus on this Cloud Provider. I am a Certified Cloud Practitioner since August 2024. I document my AWS journey (Labs, Projects, Certs..) on my Youtube Channel.


### Python
I recently started to learn Python on KodeKloud and hopefully I can soon share some Python based Projects here :).





### CloudUploader-CLI

As one of my first project I built a clouduploader in bash, to Upload Files into S3 buckets on AWS over the CLI:
