# Ilyas El-Hallaoui

I’m a 19-year-old dual student (Business Informatics) and hands-on DevOps/Cloud learner.  
**My philosophy:** I don’t “study about” tech — I **touch it, break it, fix it, and ship it**. I learn by doing, documenting, and iterating.

---

## What I’m focused on (practice first)

- **Linux & Bash (daily CLI reps)**
  - Small, frequent scripts and mini-tools to automate real tasks.
  - Repo (practice + exercises):  
    - Bash study: <https://github.com/Ilyos-creater/Linux-Bash-Study>

- **Docker (packaging & repeatable envs)**
  - Labs & tiny services to internalize images, layers, networks & volumes.  
    <https://github.com/ilyos-creater/DockerLab>

- **Python (tooling for DevOps)**
  - Simple, useful scripts/APIs that solve my own problems first.  
    <https://github.com/ilyos-creater/Pythonlab>

- **Cloud (build > read)**
  - Azure-hosted Cloud Resume (IaC + CI/CD experiments around it):  
    Repo: <https://github.com/ilyos-creater/azure-resume>  
    Live: <https://happy-bush-01f706410.6.azurestaticapps.net/>

- **Kubernetes (soon)**
  - Homelab plans (k3s → RBAC, networking, observability, GitOps).

## How I work

- **Practice > Theory:** concepts stick when I apply them immediately.
- **Tight feedback loops:** logs, tests, and small commits over big “mystery” changes.
- **Readable by default:** clear README files, comments, and issue notes.
- **AI policy:** I use AI **only for feedback, code reviews, and conceptual explanations** — **not** for solutions. I must understand everything I run.

---

## Weekly learning rhythm (simple & consistent)

- **Mon – Python**
- **Tue – Docker**
- **Thu – Linux / Shell**

Everything I push here is a reflection of that routine: tiny, useful, and improving.
